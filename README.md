## Description
As mentioned under the title, this is our final project for the advanced graphics course at Clemson University.
For this project, we are creatively rendering a teapot in OpenGL. The final render of each team will be judged
at the end of the semester by a panel of teapot rendering experts. The best render will recieve an actual teapot, 
so the stakes are high!

## TBD
#### Matthew Pfister:
Create an OpenGL main driver that displays the teapot sitting above the origin atop the x-z plane.
